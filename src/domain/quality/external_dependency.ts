/**
 * How a project that reaches an external network must be verified at each V-model level.
 *
 * A live run produced a scraper whose parser matched nothing on the real page, and every level
 * below acceptance passed: the unit test fed `parseHTML` a fragment written to match the parser's
 * own regular expression, and the integration and module levels replaced the scraper with a stub, so
 * the parser never ran. Acceptance was the first place real data met real code — and the corrective
 * loop then stubbed acceptance too, after which the suite was green and carried no information about
 * whether the product worked.
 *
 * The rule that closes it is about *where the data comes from*, not about mocking as such:
 *
 * - **S001–S004** own the paired baseline suites. Mocks are allowed, and Record/Replay can capture
 *   representative real responses without making the baseline depend on a live service.
 * - **S005-S008** independently inspect the baseline and may add risk-driven tests only under their
 *   verification-owned namespace. The frozen combined suite uses Record/Replay for external data.
 * - The **Phase delivery gate**, outside the eight Step gates, executes declared real-user scenarios
 *   against live dependencies with Replay disabled.
