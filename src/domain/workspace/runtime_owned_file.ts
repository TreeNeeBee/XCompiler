 * A refusal that only says "not in your allowlist" leaves a Step nothing to try: the path it was
 * refused is one the tooling itself created, and no amount of guessing reveals that. Three separate
 * live runs lost a Ticket's whole attempt budget to exactly that — the dependency manifest, the
 * pytest bootstrap, and a fabricated assessment field — so the remedy travels with the ownership
 * rather than being remembered at each call site.
 *
 * Declared once because it was previously stated in four places that had already drifted apart:
 * `fs.ts` refused the manifest twice with two different messages, `lint.ts` had a third wording, and
 * `tests/conftest.py` — equally Runtime-owned — had none at all and so fell through to the generic
 * message that says nothing.

 * protects nothing and blocks the only repair available — and the refusal says Runtime "puts the
 * bootstrap at the top", which is false when Runtime has written nothing.

 * A live run spent eight attempts there: `tests/conftest.py` did not exist, its tests could not
 * import `src/`, the Step correctly decided to create it, and was refused each time on the strength
 * of a file that was not there. It read the refusal, checked the directory, found nothing, and tried
