/**
 * Identifies the XCompiler build that is running, not the release it claims to be.
 *
 * The version string is fixed for a whole release, so it cannot answer the question the retry
 * policy actually needs: *has the toolchain changed since this failure was recorded?* Without an
 * answer, a Ticket that stopped for non-convergence stops forever. Repairing the defect that caused
 * the recurrences changes nothing, because the evidence blocking the retry was gathered under a
 * build that no longer exists — a live run reached exactly that state, and the only way forward was
 * to abandon a workspace with three delivered Steps and sixteen landed merges.
 *
 * The fingerprint is the running module's size and mtime. It is not a content hash: this is asked
 * once per process and has to stay cheap, and size-and-mtime already distinguishes every rebuild,
 * which is the only distinction being made. Two builds that differ but collide here would be a
 * missed retry, never a wrong one.
