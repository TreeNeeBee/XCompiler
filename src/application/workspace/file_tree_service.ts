 * Before this existed, seven call sites across the tools wrote files straight through `node:fs`,
 * so no part of the system could answer what the project contained without walking the disk. That
 * is the shape this codebase keeps getting caught by — one concept decided in several places — and
 * an index maintained at seven of them would drift at the first one that forgot.
 *
 * Every mutation goes through `record`, which stats the real file and folds the result into the
 * tree. Readers go through `stat`/`list`, which hold the read side of the lock. The tree is
 * therefore always a statement about what the filesystem actually contained at a point in time,
 * never a prediction of what a caller intended to write.
