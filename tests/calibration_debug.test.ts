/**
 * These cases used to guard a static rule table in `calibration.ts` that turned a failure log into
 * repair instructions. The table was removed: nothing in production ever called it, so every bundle
 * tree-shook it away and no model ever saw a single rule. Its knowledge now lives in the Debug Wiki,
 * and the distinctions it encoded belong to the classifier that actually runs.
 *
 * The intent is unchanged and is what these assertions keep: a failure produced by *our* provider
 * must never be answered with advice aimed at the *generated project's* API integration. That would
 * rewrite working code to repair something that was never broken.
